You do not need to be a developer to benefit from these videos. I make two types of videos. The first type are basics of the languages I have learned through my career. The goal is to help new developers grasp concepts more quickly. The second videos are software solutions not involving code that help in the workplace. Sometime there is overlap in these videos where properly implementing these no-code solutions at the advanced level requires knowledge in the fundamentals of a language (ex. Javascript with HubSpot.)",
