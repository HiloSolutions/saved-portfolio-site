# My Portfolio Website

![Frontend](https://img.shields.io/badge/FrontEnd-React-blue)

>I kept my portfolio website simple, but added fun and professional animations to challenge myself. My portfolio is a space for new ideas and self-expression. My favorite feature is the header, which features a moving gradient created by constructing circles in React, applying physics principles for bouncing motion, enlarging them for overlap, and adding a blur effect to the canvas.

GitHub is a great platform for showcasing my projects, but I wanted my website to present them in a way that's easy for people who aren't familiar with it. By clicking the "view details" button on each portfolio card, you can see the stack I used and a description of the project.
